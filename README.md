# SimpleBitTorrent
My master research direction is Blockchain, but I don't have much interest in it. I am interested in P2P networks and distributed systems, so I want to build a distributed system from scratch. As strictly end users of P2P systems, I started my journey facing a very large learing curve. Much research was needed for us to understand the history and internals of these system.
